## Philosophy

Fides Protocol intentionally uses pseudonymous contribution. This is not about hiding — it's about focusing on the protocol, not personalities.

Ideas without faces are harder to attack ad hominem.

## How to Contribute

2. Understand the principles — they are inviolable
3. Submit issues or pull requests via GitHub
